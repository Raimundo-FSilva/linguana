What Happened at Olympia in Greece? That from these events the spirit of hospitality developed? It is concluded that the events had their origins in the past, but have been perpetuated to the present day as they represent an effective way of integrating people and cultures.<br/><br/>

            It's in Brazil? When were the first events held?
            “In Brazil, the holding of events predates the arrival of the Royal Family. According to records from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, some fairs were held that had characteristics similar to those that took place in the Middle Ages, that is, they took place in open spaces, where traders set up their stalls to sell their products”. (MATIAS 2001:10).
